Q1)

Determine the following statements as true or false with enough reasons.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*-]
\item
Both trasport and network layer protocols provide logical communication between processes running at different hosts rather than hosts themselves.
\item
Transport layer packets are refered to as \textbf{datagrams}.
\item
TCP ensures that the transmitted packets would finally reach their destination, however it makes no guarantee on the order of packets.
\item
The IP service model is a best-effort delivery service since it guarantees to deliver segments between communicating hosts, whether orderless or not.
%\item
%Cookies are used to keep track of user IDs in a stateless HTTP server.
%\item
%Link-layer switches are typically capable of processing the packets up to the layer 3.
%\item
%SMTP and FTP are examples of layer 1 protocols while TCP is a transport layer protocol.
%\item
%API is a set of rules 
%\item
%For economical reasons, exploiting optical fibers is not recommended in long-haul network
\end{enumerate}

Q2)
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*-]
\item
Why is IP said to be an unreliable service and if so, how would TCP provide reliable data transfer on top of IP?
\item
Why are source and destination host port numbers included in segment headers? What problem could arise if they are ignored?
\end{enumerate}

Q3) Suppose Client A initiates a Telnet session with Server S. At about the same
time, Client B also initiates a Telnet session with Server S. Provide possible
source and destination port numbers for
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*-]
\item
The segments sent from A to S.
\item
The segments sent from B to S.
\item
The segments sent from S to A.
\item
The segments sent from S to B.
\item
If A and B are different hosts, is it possible that the source port number in
the segments from A to S is the same as that from B to S?
\item
How about if they are the same host?
\end{enumerate}
(Choose the port numbers at source and destination arbitrarily.)

Q4) Consider the following Figure. What are the source and destination port values in the segments
flowing from the server back to the clientsâ€™ processes? What are the IP
addresses in the network-layer datagrams carrying the transport-layer segments?
